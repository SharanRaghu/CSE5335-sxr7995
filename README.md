a. What server framework did you choose and why?
	Ruby-on-Rails 
The great thing about Ruby-on-Rails is that you can get a working prototype up and running extremely quickly. Checking the feasibility of a project is made much easier because of this.
The framework is 100% free and also open-source. It’s also easy to work with from a developer’s perspective. 

b. What client framework did you choose and why?  
	jQuery
It is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries. JQuery enables you to perform hordes of functions in comparison to other Javascript libraries.

c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
	Creating and running the project locally was easy. I was familiar with HTML and Javascript, so that knowledge helped me.
	
d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?  
	Using Heroku and deploying it using git was something new and took a lot of time.
	
e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install,  if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
	Just Ruby-on-Rails and their required components.

f. What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server? 
	These were the following set of commands used:
ruby -v
sqlite3 --version
gem install rails
rails --version
rails new <project name>
cd <project name>
bin/rails server
